### Introduction

Building a basic drone is not that difficult or complicated. In many cases the components are readily available to manufacturers and operators. This ease of assembly brings about a new set of challenges around managing assembly and parts that can be easily substituted and manufactured. In this article we document how you can leverage modern technology to build a transparent supply chain and make management of drone parts easier.

### Fleet Management

Aerobridge is an open-source implementation a Management Server that provides a number of features to help with managing drone hardware. At the time of writing, there are a number of software available to manage a fleet of drones. Basically the idea is to maintain a list of equipment, people and companies operating the drones. A more detailed introduction to these concepts please see [Building a Drone + Aircraft Registry]({{< ref "drone-aircraft-registry-101.md" >}}) article. The management server utilizes customized versions of this registry to organize the operations around equipment, people and companies.

### Supply Chain Transparency

For a small company, running a world class assembly / production is hard. In the drone context, it is even harder because the components are small and relatively cheaper to procure or build. In most cases, if a part is broken or needs to be replaced the manufacturer or the operator just buys a new one and attaches it to the drone. This makes tracking of parts in the company difficult especially in day-to-day operations. In recent years, a lot of work has been done in the automotive sector around introduction of modern technologies for storing parts and ensuring external parties can authenticate owernship.
