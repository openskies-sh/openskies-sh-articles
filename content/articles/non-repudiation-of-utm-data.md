Openskies provides foundational elements of a federated un-manned traffic management (UTM) services and also a roadmap for jurisdictions to graudally enable additional services and service providers in a international standards compatible fashion.

## Background
The [Open-UTM](https://utm.openskies.sh) stack provided is by Openskies via two products: [Flight Blender](https://flightblender.com) (backend) and [Flight Spotlight](https://flightspotlight.com) (frontend). These tools implement the published and developing international standards on UTM in code. These robust and well-tested products can be extended and customized to your particular needs as necessary and enable setting up of UTM services by government entities or private companies securely and enable these to participate in a standards-compliant federated UTM eco-system. To get a detailed introduction to the [Open-UTM system]({{< ref "open-utm-with-blender-spotlight.md" >}}), please read the linked article.

## Non-repudiation 
Given that UTM follows federated models where multiple providers exchange data, the integrity of this data is crucial. There has been a lot of work recently on understanding the security aspects of a federated UTM system.
