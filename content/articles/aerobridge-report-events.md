### What is a event? 
During flight operations sometimes there are things you want would like to keep track of, e.g. how many times batteries have been charged (or discharged), if there was damage to the propellor etc. These are normally recorded in a system like Excel or notebooks that are maintained by the Drone Operator or Drone Service Provider. Aerobridge provides the digital infrastructure to report events and associate them to specific parts. This can the operator maintain world-class events management system and develop insights into what is going.

### Applies to 
**Aerobridge Lite Plan** and above

### What do you need? 
To create a new event in Aerobridge, you will need:

- an account with the Lite plan in Aerobridge with your fleet and assembly details
- optionally a photo / image from your phone or available on your device if you would like to track that

### Report an event
Follow the steps below to report an event that happened during your operations into the Aerobridge Management Server. If you want to associate a photo, it is a  two-step process where you upload a photo first and then create an event associating the photo to a component: 

1. Step 1. Upload your photo
    - Go to ```Data locker -> Files Manager```
    - Click on ```+ Add a file```
    - Upload tour photo and select ```File type``` as ```Photo``` in the dropdown list
2. Step 2. Report an incident
    - Go to ```Trusted Flights -> Aircraft```
    - Select the impacted aircraft and click on ```+ Report an Event```
    - Select one of the ```Impacted Components```, add ```Notes``` describing briefly and precisely details about the incident.     
    - Set the ```New status``` of the component, usually it is Damaged or Needs Attention, this setting will determine the assembly status. 

### Result
Your event will be added to the management server, depending on what you set the Component status (e.g. Damaged or Destroyed), it will be removed from the Assembly automatically as well: the assembly status will be set to ```Parts need review```

### Good to know
If multiple components are impacted, then multiple event report must be created, in Aerobridge one event report is linked to one component.
